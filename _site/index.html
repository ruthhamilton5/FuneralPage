<p class="aboutUs">
For almost 100 years now Hamilton's Funeral Service have served the surrounding area.<br><br>

Started by Samuel H Hamilton, when he moved to the village of Bellaghy in the early 1900s, we are proud to say that we are one of the oldest established funeral undertaking firms in the area.<br><br>

The buisness is presently under the management of Samuel Hamilton, grandson of above. Because we are a small firm we believe that in your time of need we can offer a personal and caring service, from your first enquiry until the funeral itself and thereafter.<br><br>
