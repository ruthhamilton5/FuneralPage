For almost 100 years now Hamilton's Funeral Service have served the surrounding area.<br><br>

We are proud to say that we are one of the oldest established funeral undertaking firms in South Derry.<br><br>

The business is presently under the management of Samuel Hamilton, grandson of the founder.  Because we are a small firm we believe that in your time of need we can offer a personal and caring service from your first enquiry.<br><br>
